# Be My Valentine - YES/NO Game

A browser-based game where you control a "YES" dot that grows by eating smaller "NO" dots. Avoid larger "NO" dots or the game restarts!

## How to Play

1. Move your mouse to control the "YES" dot
2. Eat smaller "NO" dots to grow and increase your score
3. Avoid larger "NO" dots - touching one will restart the game
4. Try to get the highest score possible!

## Game Mechanics

- The "YES" dot starts at a base size
- Eating smaller "NO" dots increases your size and score
- The growth is proportional to the size of the dot you eat
- Collision with a larger "NO" dot immediately restarts the game

## Running the Game

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build process or dependencies required!
